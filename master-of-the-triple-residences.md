The first thing I did was to go on Twitter and search for `Patricia Lareme`. Surprisingly, there was an account who exactly matched the name and had a few posts, one of which was particularly interesting.

In the image I could read `Place Andre Breton`. I googled it and using Street Viewer I found the address of `22 Rue de Douai`. So, I googled again: "artist who lived at Rue de Douai 19, 19bis an 21" and found `Henri de Toulouse Lautrec`.
